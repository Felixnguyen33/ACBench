Here’s an illustrative topology:\n\nEdges:\n- (START, 1): Reading your Bible can be done independently and is a typical activity in church.\n- (START, 2): Observing pew mates can also be done independently.\n- (START, 3): Sketching is an independent activity.\n- (START, 4): Writing an outline of the sermon relies a bit on the sermon starting but for structure, we can start it right away.\n- (START, 5): Making a tally of specific words also depends on the sermon, but preparation mindset begins with START.\n- (START, 6): Taking crafts depends only on the individual's choice.\n- (START, 7): Taking a Bible Felts set is an independent choice.\n- (START, 8): Counting birds or other objects outside can start immediately.\n- (START, 9): Writing notes or texting can happen independently.\n- (START, 10): Paying attention is inherently linked with the church service progression but will start independently.\n- (START, 11): Sitting with friends is an initial decision.\n- (START, 12): Researching about living in other countries as a Christian is another independent activity.\n- (START, 13): Thinking of relatable elements in the lesson can begin early in the service or during the lesson itself.\n\nAll these tasks can start independently of each other and do not necessarily have sequential dependencies.\n\nTo end:\n- (1, END)\n- (2, END)\n- (3, END)\n- (4, END)\n- (5, END)\n- (6, END)\n- (7, END)\n- (8, END)\n- (9, END)\n- (10, END)\n- (11, END)\n- (12, END)\n- (13, END)\n\nEach subtask leads directly to the END as they are all independent ways to pass time in church.\n\nThe flow diagram will look like a many-to-one star topology where all nodes begin after START and directly precede END, depicting the independence of each activity."
